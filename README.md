🔊 GET LOUD! Mobs Can Hear You Now with Sound Attract! 🔊

Ever felt like you could sneak past anything in Minecraft? Think again. 🤫
Introducing Sound Attract — the mod that cranks realism to 11 by making mobs actually listen to their environment.

💥 MAKE SOME NOISE! 💥
Forget tiptoeing. Stomp around, break blocks, light TNT — go wild! Mobs aren’t deaf anymore. They’ll hear you and come investigate.
Use it to your advantage: lure creepers into traps, distract a zombie horde, or lead that pesky skeleton away from your loot.

🎤 Voice Chat Integration? Oh Yeah. 🎤
Using Simple Voice Chat? Now your real voice can alert mobs.
Whether you're planning an attack or screaming in panic, Sound Attract can hook into your mic and make monsters zero in.
Adjust detection radius and sensitivity in the config — you're in control.

🔫 Combat Mods? Tactical Sound Warfare Awaits. 🔫
Running TacZ or other weapon-heavy mods? Every reload, shot, or explosion can attract attention.
Customize sound behavior per mod, and turn your firefights into high-stakes stealth ops.

⚙️ Your World, Your Rules — Full Config Support! ⚙️
Don’t like default settings? We’ve got you. Crack open config/soundattract-common.toml and fine-tune everything:

🎯 Target Mobs: Choose exactly which mobs have super-hearing. Add your favorite modded ones to attractedEntities.

🎵 Sound Customization: Pick any sound ID from Minecraft or other mods using soundConfigs. Define how far the sound reaches and how “tempting” it is.

🧍 Player Noise Control: Configure how sneaking, walking, sprinting, and falling affect how much noise you generate — even based on speed!

🧠 Mob AI Behavior: Set how long sound events linger, how often mobs “scan” for noise, how far they’ll chase, and how fast they move.

🔌 Integration Options: Toggle Voice Chat and TacZ support, adjust specific sound weights and detection ranges.

Whether you're building sneaky mob traps, adding challenge to survival, or just want to hear your friends scream when a creeper hears them talking...
Sound Attract lets you tune the entire sound ecosystem of your world.

Drop the beat. Fine-tune the config. And let the mobs come to you. 🎶🧟‍♂️
